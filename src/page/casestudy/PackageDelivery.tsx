          <h1 className="font-bolder">Our Challenges</h1>
          <div>There are several platforms that do exactly what Package Delivery does. The challenge for our design team was to brainstorm and conceptualize around making the UX design different from the competitors, yet stay relevant to the industry standards.</div>

          <h1 className="font-bolder">Create Shipment</h1>
          <div>One of the more important screens was of “creating a shipment” and filling in the required details. A special feature of selecting “irregular shipment type” which could range from crockery, food to even pets was introduced.</div>

          <div>Order tracking is the most important user flow of any delivery system. While tracking screens are confusing and full of clutter, we designed the “track order” screen with a birds-eye view of the entire track history to keep the user’s efficiency in mind.</div>
